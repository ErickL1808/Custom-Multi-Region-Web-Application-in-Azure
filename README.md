<h1>Custom Multi-Region Web Application in Azure </h1>
This project focuses on deploying a highly available web application across two Azure regions using Azure Load Balancers & Traffic manager for cross-region failover. A virtual network peering was implemented for seamless connection between regions. In addition, to enhance security, NSGs were applied with security rules, DDoS protection, custom subnets for network segmentation & traffic management & a VPN Gateway was also configured to securely connect an on-premises resourse to Azure. This tutorial provides a guide on implementing a

<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>
<h3 align="center">In the Azure (portal.azure.com)</h3>
<br />

In the **Basic Tab**, Create a VM (*EastUS-VM-HA*) In this case, the VM is created in the East US region & designed to enhance fault tolerance & high avaiability.
Create a Username & strong password. Select *"none"* for public inbound ports (To enhance security by limiting direct exposure to the internet)

<br></br>

In the **Disk Tab**, create a new disk & set the disk size to 64GB for extra storage (Premium SSD). I added a disk to store logs & application data separately but it's not needed

<br></br>

In the **Networking Tab**, create a VNet (*Prod-VNet-EastUS*) associated with your VM and its designated region. Within the VNet, setup a **Web-Subnet (10.30.1.0/24)** to isolate & manage web traffic. Do not assign a Public IP directly, the Load Balancer will handle external access.

<br></br>

In the **Management Tab**, for patch orchestration options, select Azure-Orchestrated if you would like for it to be centralized and managed by Azure, ensuring consistency, compliance and high availability across all the VMs. Basically automatic patching and less manual efforts.

<br></br>

In the **Tags Tab**, create your own form of key-value pairs which helps organize, manage & track resources very effectively. Then **create**

<br></br>

**Repeat these steps & create another VM & VNet in the WestUS region** </br>
(Deploy a secondary VNet in WestUS for failover)
  - Virtual Machine (WestUS-VM-HA)
  - VNet (Prod-VNet-WestUS)
      - Subnet- 10.40.1.0/24

Create a Load Balancer (*EastUS-LB*) for the designated region & select 'Public', which allows incoming traffic from the internet to be distributed to the backend VM 
![Screenshot 2025-03-30 014300](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bb6aaf5-b335-4466-a039-620de6cfe32f)

Add a frontend IP. Click '*Create new*' and name the IP address (*PublicWebAppIP-EastUS*)
![Screenshot 2025-03-30 100926](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47130496-6fa2-46a0-90cc-aba1c1c29f8f)

Add a backend pool and name it (*EastUS-BackendPool*). Select the designated VNet. Click 'add' under IP configuration and select the VM associated to the Load Balancer. When done click 'add' then save
![Screenshot 2025-03-30 102242](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a770d4f1-cc6f-4bfb-a23d-b191d6cb2659)

Create a name for the load balancing rule (*HTTP-LB-Rule*). Select the associated frontend IP address & backend pool. Since this rule is for HTTP traffic, use port 80 as the input. Then '*Click new*' to create a Health probe

![Screenshot 2025-03-30 103128](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2becebd-0783-4165-acab-b1a813376ebd)

Give the Health probe a name (*HealthProbe-80*) . In this case, using port 80 with the HTTP protocol will monitor the health & status of HTTP traffic on the VM in your backend pool

![Screenshot 2025-03-29 230548](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12c69c24-35fc-45d6-a6e3-1ac57e7b76d1)
<br></br>

Repeat and create another **load balancing rule** (*HTTPS-LB-Rule*) with a **Health probe** for HTTPS (*HealthProbe-443*)

![Screenshot 2025-03-30 104812](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84a993c9-8656-4998-9ad1-5446d397ea75)

Include the same key-value pairs for the tags as before and **create** the load balancer

![Screenshot 2025-03-30 110302](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a87efac-ae8a-4d28-a5ff-625d8d0ace76)

**Repeat these steps & create another Load Balancer in the WestUS region**
 - Load Balancer name (*WestUS-LB*)
 - Frontend IP Configuration (*PublicWebAppIP-EastUS*)
 - Backend Pool (*EastUS-BackendPool*)
 - Load balancing rule with health probes (*HTTP/HTTPS*)
</br> 

Search **Traffic Manager** in the portal. Create a Traffic Manager Profile (*GlobalTrafficMgr*)

![Screenshot 2025-03-30 220547](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17ef6b70-8a5d-454d-bb17-64cb4d016d4f)

Head to **Endpoint** in your Traffic Manager profile. Create an endpoint (*EastUS-LB-Endpoint*) & associate it with the assigned Public IP address </br> 
***Tip**: When creating an endpoint, if you are using a public IP address as the target resource, you must assign a *DNS name label* to that public IP address in Azure

![Screenshot 2025-03-30 225034](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3658066d-4d31-46f2-817e-dcb3a32e07f6)

**<h3>Since both of the VM's were created with a private IP address**</h3>
 - **EastUS-VM-HA** - 10.30.1.4
 - **WestUS-VM-HA** - 10.40.2.4 </br>
 
There are 2 ways to connect:
1. **A jumpbox VM** within the VNet (Gives you a public-facing entry point into the network, apply NSG to restrict unknown IP addresses)
2. **Using a VPN** (VPN Gateway configures a P2S VPN connection from a local machine to the Virtual Network) </br>
***(You can't access VMs with private IPs directly from the internet)***

<h1>Jumpbox VM</h1>

Create a VM (*TestVM*) in the **EastUS VNet** and connect to it via RDP from a local machine 

![Screenshot 2025-03-31 100952](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95ed09eb-2981-4769-8a51-1dc6bbfcb6b8)

After deploying the VM (*TestVM*) into the **Web-Subnet** (*10.30.1.0/24*), it will be assigned a private IP address (*10.30.1.7*) from that range </br>
***(When running ipconfig /all, you are seeing the VMâ€™s internal IP address, not its public IP)***

![Screenshot 2025-04-07 154420](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79fe1846-8db4-4092-badd-a48d1c566deb)

Remote into ***EastUS-VM-HA*** through the TestVM via RDP (*Private IP*: ***10.30.1.4***)

![Screenshot 2025-04-07 162624](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/563f258f-9848-45e1-87fd-dd7582986afa)

Ping **EastUS-VM-HA** (*10.30.1.4*) from the local machine</br>
(Pings from my local machine or any device outside the VM's virtual network will not reach to the VM)

![Screenshot 2025-04-07 163109](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9c3aeaa-9607-4851-8587-c34a4cf6e8c5)

Login to **EastUS-VM-HA** and make sure *ICMPv4* is enabled on the *local Windows Firewall*</br>
Then ping **EastUS-VM-HA** (*10.30.1.4*) through the TestVM since only machines within the same VNet can connect to it </br>

<h1>Azure VPN Gateway</h1>

Create a VM (*TestVM*) in the **EastUS VNet** and connect to it via RDP from a local machine 







This VM will be configured with a Private IP address only. 

"When setting up a Virtual Machine in Azure, I need to ensure high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance. Instead of using the default VNet, I would design a custom networking architecture that supports a globally distributed application."

Step-by-Step Guide: Configuring High Availability, Load Balancing, and Security in Azure


When enabling "none" for Public Inbound ports, all traffic from the internet will be blocked by default. You can change the inbound port rule 
	****(Public IP: Choose None (since Load Balancer will manage traffic)***


Choosing the Frontend IP for Your Load Balancer in Azure
When creating a Load Balancer for your High-Availability Web Application, the Frontend IP Configuration tab requires you to specify an IP address that clients will use to access your application.

Each load-balancing rule (one for HTTP, one for HTTPS) needs an associated health probe to determine whether a backend VM is responsive for that specific protocol.


Health Probe checks if your backend VMs are responding correctly. When path is set to "/", the probe will send HTTP request to / (the root of your web server) verify it is running.

Routing Preference:
Determines how your traffic routes between Azure and the Internet
Microsoft Network - Selecting Microsoft global network delivers traffic via Microsoft global network closest to user. 
Internet - Uses transit ISP network. 
Routing preference option of a Public IP canâ€™t be changed once created
nd select Microsoft network as the routing preference (Delivers traffic via Microsofts global network to users)
